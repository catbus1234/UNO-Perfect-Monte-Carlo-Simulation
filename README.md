# Playing the UNO card game using Perfect Monte Carlo Simulation

Author: Josh Chen and Tavie Kitteredge, based on the repository created by Bernhard Pfann (https://github.com/bernhard-pfann/uno-card-game-rl)

## Description

Similar to Bernhard Pfann's work, we tried to tackle the UNO card game uisng machine reasoning strategies. However, we opted to try Perfect Monte Carlo Simulation instead as our strategy instead of reinforcement learning. Using the base repository of Bernhard Pfann, we modified scripts including agents, cards, game, players.py, and implemented our own scripts randomgame.py and randomplay.py as part of our simulation.

## Repository Structure

 - `assets/` collection of .csv files that are generated by execution of `run.py`
 - `notebooks/` analysis of simulated games
 - `src/` core package to simulate games
 - `config.py` configurable parameters
 - `run.py` executation file
